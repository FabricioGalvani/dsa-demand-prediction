# 3. Data preparation and Exploration (Feature Engineering oriented to the 4th phase)
#     - Is my dataset tidy?
#     - Is my dataset clean?
#     - Which correlations exists between all variables and to the target?
#     - There is any NA in my dataset? If so, how should I treat them? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I narrowing in on observations of interest? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I reduce my variables? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I create new variables that are functions of existing ones? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I binning variables? Which effects would it have?
#     - should I convert variables (categorical = numerical / vv)? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I dummy coding categorical variables? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I standardize numerical variables? Which effects would it have?
#     - Can I test my hypotheses?
