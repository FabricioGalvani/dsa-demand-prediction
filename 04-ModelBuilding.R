# 4. Building and validating models
#     - Train and test a ML model
#         I plan to use 3 algorithms:
#           randomForest (from caret package)
#           Boosted Tree (from caret package)
#           autoML (from h2o package)
#
#     - Which performance metrics should I relly on?
#       I'll relly on Accuracy
