#### Personal framework for a systematic approach ####


#___________ FUNDAMENTALS ___________#
#
# 1. Problem statement and comprehension of the context
#     - What am I trying to solve?
#     - Who will benefit of/is asking for this solution?
#     - What would be the ideal scenario for them?
#     - How could I use the available data to help them achieve this scenario?
#     - Why solve this problem? (purpose)
#
# 2. Looking for data:
#     - Identify entities (and its attributes) of the problem
#     - Collect data that represents entities
#     - Which hypotheses could I suppose?
#     - Explore the data (superficially) to understand it
#     - Could I use an algorithm to address the issue or solve it? Which one?



#___________ DATA WRANGLING ___________#
#
# 3. Data preparation and Exploration (Feature Engineering orientated to the 4th and 5th phase)
#     - Is my dataset tidy?
#     - Is my dataset clean?
#     - Which correlations exists between all variables and to the target?
#     - There is any NA in my dataset? If so, how should I treat them? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I narrowing in on observations of interest? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I reduce my variables? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I create new variables that are functions of existing ones? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I binning variables? Which effects would it have?
#     - should I convert variables (categorical to numerical / vv)? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I dummy coding categorical variables? Which effects would it have?
#     - Should I standardize numerical variables? Which effects would it have?
#     - Can I test my hypotheses?
#
# 4. Building and validating models (orientated to the 5th phase)
#     - Train and test a ML model
#     - Which performance metrics should I rely on?
#     - Iteration



#___________ DEPLOYING ___________#
#
# 5. Deploy
#     - Data StoryTelling
#     - How can I deploy the model to production?
#     - Which strategies should I consider?
#     - An overview of what should be considered:

#### End of framework ####


# 1. Problem statement and comprehension of the context
#     - What am I trying to solve?
#         I should accurately forecast inventory demand based on historical sales data.
#         I also should make sure consumers of over 100 bakery products arenâ€™t staring at empty shelves, while
#         also reducing the amount spent on refunds to store owners with surplus product unfit for sale.
#
#     - Who will benefit of/is asking for this solution?
#         Grupo Bimbo itself.
#         Resellers of fresh bakery products from Grupo Bimbo.
#         All final consumers of Grupo Bimbo products.
#
#     - What would be the ideal scenario for them?
#         Currently, daily inventory calculations are performed by direct delivery sales employees who must
#         single-handedly predict the forces of supply, demand, and hunger based on their personal experiences
#         with each store. With some breads carrying a one week shelf life, the acceptable margin for error
#         is small.
#
#         The ideal scenario to Grupo Bimbo would be:
#           To know beforehand and accurately what would be the demand for its products.
#           Doing so, be able to produce the necessary amount to support the demand, reducing waste,
#           warehousing costs, maximizing production efficiency, optimizing routes, and so on.

#
#         The ideal scenario to resellers would be:
#           To have its demands supported on time; to have fresh products to offer
#
#         The ideal scenario to final consumers would be:
#           To always have fresh and diversified bakery products on shelves.
#
#     - How could I use the available data to help them achieve this scenario?
#         By doing a descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analysis.
#
#     - Why solve this problem? (purpose)
#         To help develop and strengthen a data-driven business culture.
