# 2. Looking for data:
#     - Identify entities (and its attributes) of the problem
#     - Collect data that represents entities
#     - Which hypotheses could I suppose?
#     - Explore the data (superficially) to understand it
#     - Could I use an algorithm to address the issue or solve it? Which one?
